# micci-scrape
Ever been told by your boss: "Please scrape this website of all information!" and it turns out there are around 700 entries into the site? Well yeah I've been there man, thats why I made this.

The is a short Python script I made to make life easier for me. Basically just scrape all of the information from the MICCI website, also since its a .aspx site, I cannot for the life of me manage to only use the requests library for this one, so I opted to use Selenium instead. 

As usual, I am also using the Pandas library to make it all nice and pretty and using it to convert it into a .csv too, since my boss likes to keep all this information in Google Drive.

The .csv file is also included for... proof-of-work? If the MICCI guys dont want me to keep it, I'll gladly take it down.
